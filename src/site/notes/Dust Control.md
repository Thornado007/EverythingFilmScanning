Sandwich-style holders, especially those involving glass or plastic to flatten the film, make **dust control more challenging**. Dust trapped between the negative and the glass will appear prominently in the scan and can be time-consuming to remove in post-processing.

**To manage dust effectively:**

- Use **anti-static gloves**
- Clean all surfaces with **a powerful blower** and **soft antistatic brushes**
- Keep your scanning area as dust-free as possible

Prevention during scanning will save you hours of retouching later.

Here are recommended products:

Keyboard air blower:
Not made for film scanning but I found it very useful and more powerful than a rocket blower

Rocket blower

Nitrile Gloves

Antistatic coton gloves

Antistatic brushes
you can use Vinyl LP brushes for this

Kinetronics stuff

Air compressor

Store negative well in sleeves
