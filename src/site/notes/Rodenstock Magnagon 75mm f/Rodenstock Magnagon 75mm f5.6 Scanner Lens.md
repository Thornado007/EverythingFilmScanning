The Magnagon 5.6/75 is a special lens made for the scanner industry by Rodenstock for use with linear scanner CCDs using low-dispersion glass for lateral and longitudinal chromatic aberration control.  The Magnagon 75mm f/5.6 lens you see above was removed from Fuji Lanovia Sprint C550 high-end flatbed scanner. An f/8 version of the Magnagon lens is used in Hasselblad Flextight X5 scanner

# The Red Filter
In testing I found that the lens is optimized to work with the filter so it should be left in place for photography. Without the filter the lens is slightly sharper but suffers from CAs or lateral chromatic aberrations. With the filter in place the Magnagon is free from CAs.

Normally a deep red filter is used in machine vision applications to pass UV and cut visible light but in this case the filter does not seem to have this kind of effect in this case.


Like: 
Sharpness
APO chromatic correction
Compact iris housing

Can live with: 
Built-in red filter

Disappointed with: 
Lack of iris
Conservative maximum aperture
Can be hard to locate on the used market

Image Quality: very good sharpness and free from chromatic aberrations from edge to edge.
