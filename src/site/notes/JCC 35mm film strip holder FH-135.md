# Personal Notes
I really like the concept of this holder—it's specifically designed for scanning film strips, making it ideal for digitizing archives of old negatives that have already been cut and sleeved. It is basically an updated version of the classic film strip holders for flatbed scanners which clamp each frame separately by not usic acrylic but adding "vertical" support to the short edges of the frame. Here is a link to one of these: [[Konica Minolta FH U-1 film holder\|Konica Minolta FH U-1 film holder]] The design uses a "sandwich" method: one side is open, and the other side is made of acrylic. This approach allows for quick loading and decent film alignment, making it ideal for bulk scanning—whether you're using a flatbed scanner like the Epson V-series or a digital camera scanning setup.

The idea is solid, especially for scanning film strips efficiently. However, I found some practical limitations. When inserting the film correctly—with the shiny side facing the open side of the holder and the matte side facing the acrylic to avoid Newton rings—the natural curl of the film (typically with the shiny side curving upwards) prevents it from lying completely flat in the middle.

Reversing the film, so the shiny side faces the acrylic, and pressing the edges into place improves flatness, but this increases the risk of Newton rings due to contact with the acrylic surface. Another issue is dust: the acrylic seems to attract dust due to static charge which it is prone to, and it's difficult to blow away, especially once it's trapped between the film and the acrylic.

Despite these issues, the holder remains a very handy solution—especially when perfect flatness isn't essential and for scanning a lot of film strips. It's lightweight, easy to load, and significantly speeds up the scanning process. For camera scanning, I recommend adding guide rails (e.g., using thick tape or foam strips) to keep the holder aligned when moving from frame to frame. This small tweak can improve consistency and speed during batch scanning.
