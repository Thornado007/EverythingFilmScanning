A **copy stand** is an essential piece of equipment used in camera-based film scanning workflows. Its primary function is to provide a stable, vertically-oriented platform that allows a camera to be precisely aligned over film negatives or slides during digitization. This setup ensures that the camera sensor is perfectly parallel to the film, which is critical for achieving sharp, distortion-free, and evenly focused scans.

Typically consisting of a sturdy base, a vertical column, and a mount for the camera, a copy stand helps eliminate variables like camera shake, misalignment, or uneven lighting. It also enables consistent framing and repeatable results, which is especially important for batch scanning.

### Ensuring Perfect Sensor-to-Film Parallelism

Achieving perfect **sensor parallelism** to the film plane is not optional—it’s essential. Even a slight tilt can lead to one side of the image being out of focus, especially at high magnification. To fine-tune this alignment, it is **highly recommended** to mount the camera to a **3-way gear head**—such as the **Manfrotto 410** or **405**. These heads allow for **precise, incremental tilting and panning** in all directions, making it possible to perfectly align the camera to the film.

One effective method for checking parallelism is the **mirror trick**: place a small mirror on the film plane and observe the camera lens reflection through the viewfinder or live view. When the lens’s reflection is **centered in the frame**, the sensor is exactly perpendicular to the film. If it’s off-center, adjust the gear head until it is perfectly aligned.

### Importance of Fine Adjustment for Focus

For users employing **scanner lenses** or **dedicated macro lenses** that lack an autofocus or manual focus ring—such as enlarger lenses adapted for scanning—the copy stand becomes even more critical. In these cases, the only way to achieve precise focus is by adjusting the **height of the camera** with extreme accuracy. A copy stand with **fine vertical adjustment capability**—such as a geared column or micro-adjustment crank—is essential for achieving exact focus, especially when working at high magnifications.

Without this precision, the resulting scans may suffer from subtle blur or uneven focus across the frame, undermining the quality and resolution benefits of a high-end scanning setup.

When choosing a copy stand, prioritize **rigidity, fine adjustment control, and alignment stability**, especially if you're working with manual-focus or adapted scanner lenses.

## Beseler CS Copy Stand
A heavy-duty stand with a large base and geared column, often used in archival and reproduction work.


## Novoflex Copy Stand
Compact and modular, ideal for precision work with light camera setups

## Valoi Copy Stand
Designed specifically for film scanning workflows, with high stability and fine-tuned vertical adjustments.

## Homemade / DIY Options
While less ideal for precision, some users build custom setups using 3D-printed components or repurposed enlargers with geared height controls.    

## Durst Adapted Enlarger Copy Stand

An adapted Durst enlarger copy stand repurposes the robust column and base of a vintage Durst photographic enlarger—such as the M601 or M605—for use in camera-based film scanning. These enlargers feature solid, vibration-resistant construction and precise, geared height adjustment, making them ideal for positioning a camera with high accuracy. By removing the enlarger head and attaching a camera mount (often custom or 3D-printed), the Durst column can serve as a stable and precise copy stand. Its smooth vertical movement and heavy-duty build make it especially suitable for use with macro lenses and high-resolution digital cameras.
