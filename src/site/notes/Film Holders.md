Film holders are an essential part of a high-quality camera scanning setup. Their primary role is to **keep the film flat and properly aligned** beneath the camera. This is crucial when working at close distances with **macro or scanner lenses**, especially those with a shallow depth of field and **no internal focusing or adjustable aperture**. Any curl or unevenness in the film can cause **focus inconsistencies**, resulting in parts of the image appearing soft or distorted.

### Why Film Flatness Matters
Achieving film flatness is one of the most important goals in camera scanning. Because digital scanning is often done at high magnifications, **even minor film curvature** can push parts of the image out of the lens's focal plane. When the film is flat, the image stays sharp **across the entire frame**; when it’s not, some areas will be noticeably softer.

Film holders also help prevent light spill by providing a **tight mask around the edges of the negative**. This keeps unwanted light from bouncing around or causing **flare or ghosting**, which can degrade image quality—particularly in the shadow areas.

### Types of Film Holders
Film holders come in many shapes and formats, but can generally be divided into **two main categories**:

####  Sandwich Holders (Pressure-Based)
These holders use two flat surfaces—such as **glass, acrylic, or precision-cut masks**—to gently press the film flat. This method ensures **excellent flatness**, especially for curled or older negatives.

**Advantages:**
- Consistent flatness across the frame
- Ideal for high-resolution or archival-quality scanning because of the high flatness

**Drawbacks:**
- Slower to operate, since the film must be manually re-sandwiched between scans
- Can trap dust, requiring careful cleaning, see [[Dust Control\|Dust Control]]
- Risk of [[Newton rings\|Newton rings]] if non Anti-Newton glass is used

Examples:

- [[JCC 35mm film strip holder FH-135\|JCC 35mm film strip holder FH-135]] Holds up to five 35mm frames in a single glass-free sandwich
- [[Autocarrier\|Autocarrier]]: Combines film holder and automated transport system using pressure plates (expensive, 35mm only)
- [[Durst Sivoneg\|Durst Sivoneg]]

####  Gate Holders (Non-Pressure-Based)
These film holders provide a **thin gate or channel** for the film to slide through without direct pressure. The film is held in place but not pressed flat.

**Advantages:**
- Fast and efficient for batch scanning
- Simpler handling

**Drawbacks:**
- Less reliable flatness, especially with curled or uneven film
- May require external flattening aids for consistent sharpness

These are popular in modular systems like [[VALOI 360\|VALOI 360]] , **Negative Supply**, or [[Essential Film Holder\|Essential Film Holder]] systems, many of which offer **interchangeable parts** for scanning multiple formats.

### Format Compatibility
Some film holders are designed specifically for **a single format** (e.g., 35mm), while others are part of **modular systems** that support multiple film types like 120 (medium format) or even large format film. Modular systems offer flexibility but may compromise a bit on rigidity or ease of use compared to dedicated format-specific holders.

## Final Thoughts

Finding the perfect film holder is a personal journey—it depends on your **workflow**, **format**, **budget**, and whether you prioritize **speed or absolute image quality**. From fast gate-style holders to precision sandwich systems, each option comes with trade-offs.

While many commercial holders offer convenience, few deliver **perfect flatness out of the box**. In most cases, a custom or modified sandwich-style solution will yield the **best results**, especially when scanning **curled negatives or at very high resolutions**.

## Nikon film holders
- Nikon ES-1 (https://www.film4ever.info/gallery#h.2lu5gp7fgo8r ) is one of simpliest ones and can do only slides.
- Nikon ES-2 is versatile device good for slides and strips of film . JCC adapter ( https://www.film4ever.info/gallery#h.7xzwe3glpyvo ) is basically the knock-off of Nikon ES-2.
- Nikon PB4 and PB6 are very solid and robust devices. If used with Nikon bellows they are rock-solid, if one decides to incorporate them in its own design - certain metal working skills are required.  It makes sense to discuss these holders separately as they still unvaluable piece of equipment.
