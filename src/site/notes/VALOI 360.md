This VALOI LightAdapter is a sturdy platform with space for the Cinestill CS-LITE to slot in then screw in place. Screwing together the light with the LightAdapter and the LightAdapter with the Advancer allows for a super sturdy setup.

# Film Masks
Including the 6x4.5, 6x6, 6x7 Film masks, this kit gives you all the options when scanning 120 film. The masks help reduce additional light when scanning formats smaller than 6x9 film in the 120 Holder. This improves contrast, which has a dramatic effect on older lenses.

The VALOI Duster is perhaps the most popular accessory for the VALOI 360 system. It has an aluminium frame, anodised completely black with a matte surface to ensure there are no reflections. In it, we have set two high-quality brushes with anti-static brushes that have an extremely fine bristle to ensure it doesn't scratch film. Here you get it as part of a kit at a great price! 

# Levelling Mirror
The levelling mirror is a modest addition to your kit but perhaps one that gives the biggest possible as it allows you to accurately and quickly ensure your film and camera sensor is parallel. This ensures square images with even focus across the whole image area and is critical to a good result. Read more about the VALOI 360 Levelling Mirror
