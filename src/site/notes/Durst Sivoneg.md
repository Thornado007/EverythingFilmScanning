This is the Durst Sivoneg adjustable negative carrier for the [[Durst M601\|Durst M601]] enlarger. It is made out of metal and can be used to enlarge negatives from 35mm and medium format film (6x4,5cm and 6x6cm). There is a light grey version and a matte black of this carrier.

Please note that you will also need either glass ([[Durst Sivogla AN\|Durst Sivogla AN]]) or metal masks [[Durst Sixma 66\|Durst Sixma 66]], [[Durst Sivopar - Sivoma & Sixma 35\|Durst Sivopar - Sivoma & Sixma 35]] to use this carrier. The film gets sandwiched in between those plates. Made for the Durst M601 model.

The basic outfit consists of a hinged negative carrier for all negative sizes up to 6 x6 cm. This carrier has four Individually adjustable masking strips (22 and 23) to mask down the negative area. The lower part of the carrier has two adjustable film stops (24) for 6x6 cm and for 24x36 mm films, The negative carrier glasses (25) keep the negatives completely flat. A specially coated negative carrier glass (available separately) to prevent Newton's rings (Order Code SIXGLA AN) can be fitted In place of the regular glass of the upper negative carrier section. The carrier will also take glassless metal masks (Order Code SIXMA) in place of the negative carrier glasses, These metal masks are available for all negative sizes from 8x11 mm to 6x6 cm. For glassless enlarging of 24 x 36 mm and 6x6 cm negatives use the SIVOMA 35 or SIVOMA 66 mask inserts respectively in place of the upper negative carrier glass. For Inserting single negatives the negative carrier is removed from the enlarger head. On pushing the carrier into the head the upper and lower halves are pressed together to prevent movement of the negative, To insert film strips, slightly raise the opening bar (21) of the negative carrier. This locks the top of the carrier open, The film strip can now be pushed in from the front. It is accurately located when it abuts the guide pins. These guides are adjustable: the front position Is for 24 x 36 mm negatives, and the rear position is for 6x6 cm films, To close the negative carrier press the key on the opening bar. Always insert the negatives Into the negative carrier with the emulsion side (the mat side) downwards

The negative carrier does usually come with adjustable masks which can be adjusted with the red slider buttons. They can be adjusted to the size of the negative to avoid flare and light leaks. The masks can be seen in use here:
